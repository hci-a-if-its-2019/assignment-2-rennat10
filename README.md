# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches
Sketch at least **3 (three)** different UIs for the functions you are targeting. These three interfaces should be _dramatically different_ in terms of design directions. For example, they can be with different organizations of what functions on each screen or using a different layout of the icons, widgets, and menus on the screens. If you want, you can also incorporate non-on-screen UIs: physical buttons, gestures through motion sensors, etc.

You need **not** sketch the whole interface. It is not necessary for the sketches to have every function or every function in detail, but there should be enough to show off your general idea. **Be creative!** Draw your idea and label a few of the widgets so we can tell your intent. The goal is to have at least 3 good UIs in *interesting* ways. Sketches should be done on paper with pens and/or pencils (do not use a computer).

### 1. Scan/Photo of Sketches
```
Be sure to label the different versions so you can differentiate them in your discussion. 
If you choose to take a picture of your sketches, please make sure the texts are readable.

### 2. Version Differences
```
First Version
In the first version, if we open the website, the login form will be pop up, we can close the login form pop up, and after we close the login form pop up, if we want to login, we can click Sign In (it must be Login) and the login form will pop up again. The center is news, and in the sidebar it will be fill with contact, info, etc
Second Version
In the second version, the design is likely the original design, the login form is in the center of website, the sidebar will likely the first version, and the website can be scroll and in the bottom (or maybe on the center after we scroll the website) of website, there will be news
Third Version
The third version is likely the first version, but the login form will not pop up in the first we open the website, and in the top right corner of website is not the login button like the first version but it is a login form at the top right corner of the website.

```

### 3. Selected Sketch
```
I choose the first version because the i think the first version is more interesting because the design is simple and looks like elegant, and easy to use it
```

### 4. Design Rationale
```
User feel confused to reset password (it is like forget password) because there's no such feature.
```

## Part B: Assumptions

```
### 2. Users
